  <span>Vanillish</span>
</h1>

A lightweight and beautiful vanilla experience.

What Vanillish adds are **quality of life (QoL)** mods such as Mouse Tweaks to make your experience better, **aesthetic** mods such as Iris Shaders to make Minecraft look good, and **optimization** mods such as Sodium to make Minecraft fast and performant.

Vanillish doesn’t change any sort of gameplay - it fully sticks to the original. Which, of course, means that it **can be used with any vanilla server** (and vanilla singleplayer worlds)! There are no new blocks or items added in the modpack, and there aren’t any sneaky cheat mods that are banned by servers.

## Installation

### 1. MultiMC Auto-Updating Pack (recommended)

[**Download here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanccn/vanillish/main/auto-updating-pack.zip) or get one from any version on Modrinth later than v0.5.0.

This is a MultiMC pack. You can import it into MultiMC and its forks (e.g. PolyMC) by `Add Instance > Import from zip`.

### 2. Modrinth Pack (convenient)

[**Vanillish on Modrinth**](https://modrinth.com/modpack/vanillish)

These modpacks are hosted on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) and are one-off. You can visit [their documentation](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/) for more information on how to install Modrinth modpacks.

There are no CurseForge mods at all, so no need to worry!
