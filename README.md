  <span>Vanillish</span>
</h1>

A lightweight and beautiful almost vanilla experience.

What Vanillish adds to the table compared to other modpacks, are **quality of life (QoL)** mods such as Mouse Tweaks to make your experience better, **aesthetic** mods such as Iris Shaders to make Minecraft look good, and **optimization** mods such as Sodium to make Minecraft fast and performant.

Vanillish doesn‚Äôt change any sort of gameplay - it fully sticks to the original. Which, of course, means that it **can be used with any vanilla server** (and vanilla singleplayer worlds)! There are no new blocks or items added in the modpack, and there aren‚Äôt any malicious mods (such as cheats) that could get you banned by servers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
